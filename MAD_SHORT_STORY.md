# The Unlikely Elevator to Nowhere

In Seoul, a vending machine whispered, "안녕, traveler," and spat out a map that read, *no map needed*.

The map unfolded anyway: “Esto no tiene sentido,” sighed a tiny cat in a beret, switching to “mais bon, on y va.”

An elevator arrived with no doors. I stepped in, and it hummed, “Keine Sorge,” while a parrot announced, “bienvenidos al piso 0.”

At floor zero, the sky was a library. A librarian in sandals stamped my passport: “Подпись не требуется,” then winked, “pero trae pan.”

A loaf of bread fell from a cloud, stamped with “ありがとう,” and the loaf apologized in Arabic: “آسف، أنا متأخر.”

The cat ate the apology, the parrot flew backward, and the elevator evaporated, leaving one note: “끝, но продолжение где-то.”
